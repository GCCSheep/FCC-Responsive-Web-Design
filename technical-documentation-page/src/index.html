    <header>Introduction</header>
    <p>C is a general purpose programming language. It has been closely associated with the UNIX system where it was developed, since the system and most of the programs that run on it are written in C. The language, however, is not tied to any other operating system or machine; and although it has been called a "system programming language" because it is useful for writing compilers and operating systems, it has been used equaly well to write major programs in many different domais.</p>

  <section id="Types,_Operators_and_Expressions" class="main-section">
    <header>Types, Operators and Expressions</header>
    <p>Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program. Declarations list the variables to be used, and state what type they have and perhaps what their initial values are. Operators specify what needs is to be done to them. Expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values. The type of an object determines the set of values and what operations can be performed on it.</p>
    <p>There are only a few basic data types in C:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>char</li>
      <li>int</li>
      <li>float</li>
      <li>double</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The binary arithmetic operators are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, and the modulus operator <code>%</code>. Integer division truncates any fractional part.</p>
    <p>The relational operators are</p>
    <pre><code>    &gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;=</code></pre>
    <p>They all have the same precedence. Just below them in precedence are the equality operators:</p>
    <pre><code>    == !=</code></pre>
    <p>Logical operators are <code>&&</code> and <code>||</code>.</p>
    <p>The main assignment operators are <code>=</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Control_Flow" class="main-section">
    <header>Control Flow</header>
    <p>The control flow statements of a language specify the order in which computations are performed. An expression such as <code>x = 0</code> or <code>i++</code> or <code>printf(...)</code> becomes a statement when it is followed by a semicolon, as in</p>
    <pre><code>    x = 0;&NewLine;    i++;&NewLine;    printf(...);&NewLine;</code></pre>
    <p>In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator as it is in languages like Pascal.</p>
    <p>Braces <kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>}</kbd> are used to group declarations and statements together into a <em>compound statement</em>, or <em>block</em>, so that they are syntactically equivalent to a single statement. The braces that surround the statements of a function are one obvious example; braces around multiple statements after an <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>for</code> are another. There is no semicolon after the right brace that ends a block.</p>
    <p>The <code>if-else</code> statement is used to express decisions. Formally the syntax is</p>
    <pre><code>    if (<i>expression</i>)&NewLine;        <i>statement<sub>1</sub></i>&NewLine;    else&NewLine;        <i>statement<sub>2</sub></i></code></pre>
    <p>where the else part is optional.</p>
    <p>The switch statement is a multi-way decision that tests wether an expression matches one of a number of constant integer values, and branches accordingly.</p>
    <pre><code>    switch (<i>expression</i>) {&NewLine;        case <i>const-expr</i>: <i>statements</i>&NewLine;        case <i>const-expr</i>: <i>statements</i>&NewLine;        default: <i>statements</i>&NewLine;    }</code></pre>
    <p>In</p>
    <pre><code>    while (<i>expression</i>)&NewLine;        statement</code></pre>
    <p>the <i>expression</i> is evaluated. If it is non-zero, <i>statement</i> is executed and <i>expression</i> is re-evaluated. This cycle continues until <i>expression</i> becomes zero, at which point execution resumes after <i>statement</i>.</p>
    <p>The <code>for</code> statement</p>
    <pre><code>    for (<i>expr<sub>1</sub></i>; <i>expr<sub>2</sub></i>; <i>expr<sub>3</sub></i>)&NewLine;        <i>statement</i></code></pre>
    <p>is equivalent to</p>
    <pre><code>    <i>expr<sub>1</sub></i>;&NewLine;    while (<i>expr<sub>2</sub></i>) {&NewLine;        <i>statement</i>&NewLine;        <i>expr<sub>3</sub></i>;&NewLine;    }</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section id="Functions_and_Program_Structure" class="main-section">
    <header>Functions and Program Structure</header>
    <p>Functions break large computing tasks into smaller ones, and enable people to build on what others have done instead of starting over from scratch. Appropriate functions hide details of operation from parts of the program that don't need to know about them, thus clarifying the whole, and easing the pain of making changes.</p>
    <p>Each function definition has the form</p>
    <pre><code>    <i>return-type</i> <i>function-name(argument declarations)</i> {&NewLine;        <i>declarations and statements</i>&NewLine;    }</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>return</code> statement is the mechanism for returning a value from the called function to its caller. Any expression can follow <code>return</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>    return <i>expression</i>;</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section id="Pointers_and_Arrays" class="main-section">
    <header>Pointers and Arrays</header>
    <p>A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable. Pointers are much used in C, partly because they are sometimes the only way to express a computation, and partly because they usually lead to more compact and efficient code than can be obtained in other ways.</p>
    <p>The unary operator <code>&</code> gives the address of an object, so the statement</p>
    <pre><code>    p = &amp;c;</code></pre>
    <p>assigns the address of <code>c</code> to the variable <code>p</code> and <code>p</code> is said to "point to" <code>c</code>;</p>
    <p>The unary operator <code>*</code> is the <em>indirection</em> or <em>dereferencing</em> operator; when applied to a pointer, it accesses the object the pointer points to. Suppose that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are integers and <code>ip</code> is a pointer to <code>int</code>. This artificial sequence shows how to declare a pointer and how to use <code>&</code> and <code>*</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>    int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];&NewLine;    int *ip;&Tab;/* ip is a pointer to int */&NewLine;&NewLine;    ip = &amp;x;&Tab;/* ip now points to x */&NewLine;    y = *ip;&Tab;/* y is now 1 */&NewLine;    *ip = 0;&Tab;/* x is now 0 */&NewLine;    ip = &z[0];&Tab;/* ip now points to z[0] */</code></pre>
    <p>The declaration</p>
    <pre><code>    int a[10];</code></pre>
    <p>defines an array <code>a</code> of size 10; that is, a block of 10 consecutive objects named a[0], a[1], ..., a[9].</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Structures" class="main-section">
    <header>Structures</header>
    <p>A structure is a collection of one or more variables, possibly of different types, grouped together under a single name for convenient handling. Structures help to organize complicated data, particularly in large programs, because they permit a group of related variables to be treated as a unit instead of as separate entities.</p>
    <p>A basic object, such as a point, has an x and y coordinate, both integers.</p>
    <p>The two components can be placed in a structure declared like this:</p>
    <pre><code>    struct point {&NewLine;        int x;&NewLine;        int y;&NewLine;    }</code></pre>
    <p>A <code>struct</code> declaration defines a type. The right brace that terminates the list of members may be followed by a list of variables, just as for any basic type. That is,</p>
    <pre><code>    struct { ... } x, y, z;</code></pre>
    <p>is syntactically analogous to</p>
    <pre><code>    int x, y, z;</code></pre>
    <p>in the sense that each statement declares x, y, z to be variables of the named type and causes space to be set aside for them.</p>

  <section id="Input_and_Output" class="main-section">
    <header>Input and Output</header>
    <p>Input and output facilities are not part of the C language itself. Nonetheless, programs may interact with their environment in complicated ways. The standard library is a set of functions that provide input and output, string handling, storage management, mathematical routines, and a variety of other services for C programs.</p>
    <p>The simplest input mechanism is to read one character at a time from the <em>standard input</em>, normally the keyboard, with <code>getchar</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>    int getchar(void)</code></pre>
    <p><code>getchar</code> returns the next input character each time it is called, or EOF when it encounters end of file.</p>
    <p>The output function <code>printf</code> trasnlates internal values to characters.</p>
    <pre><code>   int printf(char *format, <i>arg<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>arg<sub>2</sub></i>, ...)</code></pre>
    <p><code>printf</code> converts, formats, and prints its arguments on the standard output under control of the <code>format</code>. It returns the number of characters printed.</p>
    <p>The function <code>scanf</code> is the input analog of <code>printf</code>, providing many of the same conversion facilities in the opposite direction</p>
    <pre><code>    int scanf(char *format, ...)</code></pre>
    <p><code>scanf</code> reads the characters from the standard input, interprets them according to the specification in <code>format</code>, and stores the results through the remaining arguments.</p>

  <section id="The_Unix_System_Interface" class="main-section">
    <header>The Unix System Interface</header>
    <p>The UNIX operating system provides its services through a set of <em>system calls</em>, which are in effect functions within the operating system that may be called by user programs. If you use UNIX, this should be directly helpful, for it is sometimes necessary to employ system calls for maximum efficiency, or to access some facility that is not in the library. Even if you use C on a different operating system, however, you should be able to glean insight into C programming from studying these examples; although details vary, similar code will be found on any system.</p>
